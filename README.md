# Owl Carousel Examples

This repository contains two distinct examples of implementing Owl Carousel in a web project. One is a static carousel with hardcoded items, and the other is a dynamic carousel that loads items from a JSON file.

## Static Carousel

The static carousel is a straightforward implementation of Owl Carousel with predefined items. It's a great starting point for understanding how to integrate Owl Carousel into your website.

### Features
- Basic Owl Carousel setup
- Custom navigation buttons
- Responsive design

## JSON Carousel

The JSON Carousel dynamically loads its items from a JSON file. This approach is useful for scenarios where carousel items need to be dynamically generated or fetched from an external source.

### Features
- Dynamic item rendering from JSON data
- Custom styling and navigation
- Responsive and interactive



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
